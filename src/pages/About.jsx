      <p className="mt-4">
        Since 1998, when I joined BCP â€”a mobile carrier provider starting its operation at the time â€” I've
        gained extensive experience with BSS/OSS systems and other enterprise software solutions. My deep
        technical knowledge in these systems and my other skills have enabled me to take on various sales and
        presales roles, lead successful digital transformation programs, and managed large-scale accounts, such
        as Telefonica Peru.

      </div>

      <p className="mt-4">
        Throughout my career, I've had the opportunity to live and work in different countries, which has provided
        me with a broader perspective on various cultures and markets. These experiences have enriched my understanding
        of diverse business environments and enabled me to effectively navigate and lead in multicultural settings.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-4">
        In 2022, I decided to leave the familiar corporate world and venture into the startup ecosystem. I first created
        my own company, Falck Consulting, which focuses on providing consulting services to companies that requires my skills
        and expertise, while preparing the ground for my next big move. </p>
      <p className='mt-4'>
        And recently in 2024, I co-founded Greatminds Inc., a company dedicated to creating and delivering innovative AI
        solutions tailored to customer needs.
